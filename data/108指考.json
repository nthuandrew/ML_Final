      "content": "Tempeh (or tempe), a traditional soy product from Indonesia, is hailed as the country’s “gift to the world,” like kimchi from Korea or miso from Japan.A stable, cheap source of protein in Indonesia for centuries, tempeh is a fermented food originating from the island of Java. It was discovered during tofu production when discarded soybean residue caught microbial spores from the air and grew certain whitish fungi around it. When this fermented residue was found to be edible and tasty, people began producing it at home for daily consumption across the country. This has given rise to many variations in its flavor and texture throughout different Indonesian regions.Tempeh is high in protein and low in fat, and contains a host of vitamins. In fact, it is the only reported plant-based source of vitamin B12. Apart from being able to help reduce cholesterol, increase bone density, and promote muscle recovery, tempeh has a lot of polyphenols that protect skin cells and slow down the aging process. Best of all, with the same protein quality as meat and the ability to take on many flavors and textures, tempeh is a great meat substitute—something the vegetarian and vegan communities have been quick in adopting.In addition to its highly nutritional makeup, tempeh has diverse preparation possibilities. It can be served as a main course (usually in curries) or a side dish to be eaten with rice, as a deep-fried snack, or even blended into smoothies and healthy juices. Though not yet a popular food among international diners, you may find tempeh-substituted BLTs (bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches) in San Francisco as easily as you can find vegetarian burgers with tempeh patties in Bali.For the people of Indonesia, tempeh is not just food but also has cultural value. With the Indonesian traditional fabric batik being recognized by UNESCO as “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,” tempeh has great potential for this honor as well.",

      "content": "When Dr. David Spiegel emerged from a three-hour shoulder surgery in 1972, he didn’t use any pain medication to recover. Instead, he hypnotized himself. It worked—to the surprise of everyone but Spiegel himself, who has studied hypnosis for 45 years.Hypnosis is often misunderstood as a sleep-like state in which a person is put to sleep and does whatever he is asked to do. But according to Dr. Spiegel, it is a state of highly focused attention and intense concentration. Being hypnotized, you tune out most of the stimuli around you. You focus intently on the subject at hand, to the near exclusion of any other thought. This trance-like state can be an effective tool to control pain, ease anxiety, and deal with stress.Not all people, however, are equally hypnotizable. In a recent study, Dr. Spiegel and his colleagues found that people who are easily hypnotized tend to be more trusting of others, more intuitive, and more likely to get caught up in a good movie. The research team compared people who were highly hypnotizable with those low in hypnotizability. Both groups were given fMRI scans during several different conditions: at rest, while recalling a memory, and during two sessions of hypnotism. The researchers saw some interesting changes in the brain during hypnosis—but only in the highly hypnotizable group. Specifically, there was a drop in activity in the part of the brain which usually fires up when there is something to worry about.This helps explain how hypnosis can have powerful effects, including reducing stress, anxiety, pain, and self-consciousness. Spiegel hopes that the practice can be used to replace painkillers. His own previous research has shown that when people in pain were taught self-hypnosis, they needed half the pain medication and suffered half the pain of those who were only given access to painkillers. However, more needs to be learned about hypnosis in order to harness its potential effects.",

For want of dedicated odor terminology, English speakers are often forced to use odor-sources such as “flowery” and “vanilla” and metaphors like “sweet” and “oriental” in their descriptions of smell.But the difficulty with talking about smell is not universal. The Maniq, a group of hunter-gatherers in southern Thailand, can describe smells using at least fifteen different terms, which express only smells and are not applicable across other sensory domains. In addition to Maniq, researchers found that there are also a dozen words for various smells in Jahai, a language spoken by a neighboring hunter-gatherer population.Interestingly, the difficulty for English speakers to translate smell directly into words seems to have very little to do with the nose’s actual capabilities. According to findings of a recent study, English speakers are capable of discriminating more than a trillion different odors. Then, why is there a gap between their ability to discriminate scent and their vocabulary? The researchers suggest that surroundings may play a significant role.Maniq and Jahai speakers live in tropical rainforest regions with a hunting-gathering lifestyle, and these two ethnic groups evaluate their surroundings through their noses to survive in nature. In an environment that is still largely untouched by humans, they are surrounded by smells at all times. They need to use their sense of smell to identify animals that they can hunt, and to recognize objects or events, such as spoiled food, that can pose a danger. Unlike the Maniq and the Jahai, many English speakers inhabit the post-industrial west and do not rely on smells to survive in their environment.

The animal was unknown to the western world until the beginning of the 20th century, and is often described as half-zebra, half-giraffe, as if it were a mixed-breed creature from a Greek legend. Yet its image is prevalent in the Democratic Republic of Congo—the only country in the world where it is found living in the wild. The okapi is to Congo what the giant panda is to China or the kangaroo to Australia.Although the okapi has striped markings resembling those of ’, it is most closely related to the . It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. The face and throat are greyish white. The coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. Overall, the okapi can be easily distinguished from its nearest relative. It is much smaller (about the size of a horse), and shares more external similarities with the deer than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi.The West got its first whiff of the okapi in 1890 when Welsh journalist Henry Morton Stanley had puzzled over a strange “African donkey” in his book. Other Europeans in Africa had also heard of an animal that they came to call the “African unicorn.” Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra. Some even believed that the okapi was a  of zebra. It was only later, when okapi skeleton was analyzed, that naturalists realized they had a giraffe on their hands.In 1987, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve was established in eastern Congo to protect this rare mammal. But decades of political turbulence has seen much of the Congo’s natural resources spin out of the government’s control, and okapi numbers have  percent since 1995. Today, only 10,000 remain.",

The animal was unknown to the western world until the beginning of the 20th century, and is often described as half-zebra, half-giraffe, as if it were a mixed-breed creature from a Greek legend. Yet its image is prevalent in the Democratic Republic of Congo—the only country in the world where it is found living in the wild. The okapi is to Congo what the giant panda is to China or the kangaroo to Australia.Although the okapi has striped markings resembling those of ’, it is most closely related to the . It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. The face and throat are greyish white. The coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles.

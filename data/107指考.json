      "content": "Born in 1785 in southwestern Germany, Baron Karl Drais was one of the most creative German inventors of the 19th century. The baron’s numerous inventions include, among others, the earliest typewriter, the meat grinder, a device to record piano music on paper, and two four-wheeled human-powered vehicles. But it was the running machine, the modern ancestor of the bicycle, that made him famous. The running machine, also called Draisine or hobby horse, was in effect a very primitive bicycle: it had no chains and was propelled by riders pushing off the ground with their feet. Though not a bike in the modern sense of the word, Drais’ invention marked the big bang for the bicycle’s development. It was the first vehicle with two wheels placed in line. The frame and wheels were made of wood; the steering already resembled a modern handlebar. Drais’ big democratic idea behind his invention was to find a muscle-powered replacement for the horses, which were expensive and consumed lots of food even when not in use. The machine, he believed, would allow large numbers of people faster movement than walking or riding in a coach.Drais undertook his first documented ride on June 12, 1817, covering a distance of 13 kilometers in one hour. A few months later, Drais created a huge sensation when he rode 60 kilometers in four hours. These were later followed by a marketing trip to Paris, where the hobby horse quickly caught on. The fad also quickly spread to Britain.The success of the hobby horse was short-lived, though. They were heavy and difficult to ride. Safety was an issue, too: They lacked a brake, as well as cranks and pedals. There were frequent collisions with unsuspecting pedestrians, and after a few years Drais’ invention was banned in many European and American cities. Drais’ ideas, however, did not disappear entirely. Decades later, the machine was equipped by Frenchmen Pierre Lallement and Pierre Michaux with pedals to become the modern bicycle.",

But if the flickering happens millions of times a second—far faster than the eye can see or the brain process—then it might be harnessed to do something useful, like transmitting data. This is the idea behind Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. The term Li-Fi was coined by University of Edinburgh Professor Harald Haas in a 2011 TED Talk, where he introduced the idea of “wireless data from every light.” Today, Li-Fi has developed into a wireless technology that allows data to be sent at high speeds, working with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), an increasingly popular way to illuminate public areas and homes.Using LED lights as networking devices for data transmission, Li-Fi has several advantages over Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity). First, Li-Fi allows for greater security on local networks, as light cannot penetrate walls or doors, unlike radio waves used in Wi-Fi. As long as transparent materials like glass windows are covered, access to a Li-Fi channel is limited to devices inside the room, ensuring that signals cannot be hacked from remote locations. Also, Li-Fi can operate in electromagnetic sensitive areas such as aircraft cabins, hospitals, and nuclear power plants, for light does not interfere with radio signals. The most significant advantage of Li-Fi is speed. Researchers have achieved speeds of 224 gigabits per second in lab conditions, much faster than Wi-Fi broadband.How could Li-Fi enrich daily life? Anywhere there is LED lighting, there is an opportunity for Li-Fi enabled applications. Li-Fi-enabled street lights could provide internet access to mobile phones, making walking at night safer. The LED bulbs in traffic lights could provide drivers with weather conditions and traffic updates. Li-Fi could help with tourism by providing an easier access to local information. At home, smart light could also provide parents with solutions to their children’s Internet addiction: Just turn off the lights and you’ve turned off their access.When 14 billion light bulbs mean 14 billion potential transmitters of wireless data, a cleaner, a greener, and even a brighter future is on the way.",

The study, published in the  in January 2018, shows that climate change is having an impact on these “teeny tiny” organisms.The study began with a deep dive into the scientific literature. Evolutionary ecologist Michelle Tseng and her students combed through all the articles they could find, looking for laboratory studies of temperature effects on insects. They found 19 that indicated at least 22 beetle species shrank when raised in warmer than normal temperatures.To see whether this pattern held true in the wild, the team made use of the university’s 600,000-specimen insect collection, which included thousands of bugs collected locally since the late 1800s. The researchers took photographs of more than 6,500 beetles from the eight species with the most extensive records. They also looked at climate records to determine trends in rainfall and other factors besides temperature. Sorting the beetles into size categories, they found that five of the eight species have shrunk over the past century. The four largest species of beetles, including the snail-killer ground beetles, shrank 20% in the past 45 years. In contrast, smaller beetles were unaffected or even slightly increased in size.Some ecologists are cautious about Tseng’s findings, saying that it hasn’t yet been proved whether the warming temperatures are the actual cause for the beetle shrinkage. UK biologist Alan Ronan Baudron, however, is convinced. Baudron’s studies have documented shrinkage of certain fish species due to climate warming. His account is that warmer temperatures lower the concentration of oxygen in the water, causing fish to burn energy faster and mature at a smaller size. But neither he nor Tseng is convinced that decreased oxygen can explain the shrinkage in the beetles.",

      },
      "content": "In order to protect the diversity of crops from catastrophe, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a seed bank, was built beneath a mountain on an Arctic island halfway between Norway and the North Pole. The Vault is meant to help farmers and scientists find the genes they need to improve today’s crops. It also aims to breed varieties that might better respond to emerging challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Currently, the Vault holds more than 860,000 samples, originating from almost every country in the world.There is now, however, a growing body of opinion that the world’s faith in Svalbard is misplaced. Those who have worked with farmers in the field say that diversity cannot be boxed up and saved in a single container—no matter how secure it may be. Crops are always changing, pests and diseases are always adapting, and global warming will bring additional challenges that remain unforeseen. In a perfect world, the solution would be as diverse and dynamic as plant life itself.The dispute about how best to save crop diversity centers on whether we should work with communities in the fields or with institutions, since it will be extremely difficult to find enough funding to do both. Now the isolated Svalbard seed vault is sucking up available funding. Yet, the highly centralized approach may not be able to help farmers cope with climate change, fifty or a hundred years from now. According to new research findings, as much as 75 percent of global crop diversity exists outside the big institutional seed banks. Such diversity is held instead by some of the world’s most marginal farmers. Moreover, it is argued with increasing force that seed banks can neither make up for the practical knowledge of farmers on the ground, nor compete with their ingenuity.",

      "content": "In order to protect the diversity of crops from catastrophe, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a seed bank, was built beneath a mountain on an Arctic island halfway between Norway and the North Pole. The Vault is meant to help farmers and scientists find the genes they need to improve today’s crops. It also aims to breed varieties that might better respond to emerging challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Currently, the Vault holds more than 860,000 samples, originating from almost every country in the world.There is now, however, a growing body of opinion that the world’s faith in Svalbard is misplaced. Those who have worked with farmers in the field say that diversity cannot be boxed up and saved in a single container—no matter how secure it may be. Crops are always changing, pests and diseases are always adapting, and global warming will bring additional challenges that remain unforeseen. In a perfect world, the solution would be as diverse and dynamic as plant life itself.The dispute about how best to save crop diversity centers on whether we should work with communities in the fields or with institutions, since it will be extremely difficult to find enough funding to do both. Now the isolated Svalbard seed vault is sucking up available funding. Yet, the highly centralized approach may not be able to help farmers cope with climate change, fifty or a hundred years from now. According to new research findings, as much as 75 percent of global crop diversity exists outside the big institutional seed banks. Such diversity is held instead by some of the world’s most marginal farmers. Moreover, it is argued with increasing force that seed banks can neither make up for the practical knowledge of farmers on the ground, nor compete with their ingenuity.",

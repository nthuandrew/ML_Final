Spanning New York’s East River, it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter.\tThe construction of a bridge over the East River had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 deflected all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State legislature passed an act incorporating the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn.John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held radical views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous liberal. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination.Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two masonry towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer—1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time.",

An estimated 250 million people suffer from malaria each year, and about one million die—many of them children.

Despite this achievement, scientists are faced with the challenge of giving the modified mosquitoes a competitive advantage so that they can eventually replace the wild population. Complete blockage of the malaria parasite is very important. If some of the parasites slip through the mechanism, then the next generation will likely become resistant to it. And if that happens, the scientists are back where they started. Another challenge for scientists is to gain public approval for this genetic modification regarding mosquitoes and malaria control. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the release of genetically engineered organisms without any clear knowledge of their long-term effect on ecosystems and human health. There is still a long way to go before genetic modification techniques are put to use in disease control.",

      "content": "Fabergé eggs are jeweled eggs that were made by the famous Russian jeweler, the House of Fabergé, from 1885 to 1917. The eggs were made of valuable metals or stones coated with beautiful colors and decorated with precious jewels.The first Fabergé egg was crafted for Tsar Alexander III, who gave his wife, the Empress Maria Fedorovna, an Easter egg to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. He placed an order with a young jeweler, Peter Carl Fabergé, whose beautiful creations had caught Maria’s eye earlier. On Easter morning of 1885, what appeared to be a simple enameled egg was delivered to the palace. But to the delight of the Empress, the egg opened to a golden yolk; within the yolk was a golden hen; and concealed within the hen was a diamond miniature of the royal crown and a tiny ruby egg. Unfortunately, the last two surprises are now lost to history.Empress Maria was so delighted by this gift that Alexander appointed Fabergé a “goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown.” The Tsar also asked Fabergé to make an Easter egg every year. The requirements were straightforward: Each egg must be unique, and each must contain a pleasant surprise. With excellent craftsmanship and an inventive spirit, Peter Fabergé and his successors repeatedly met the challenge. The House of Fabergé made approximately 50 Imperial Easter Eggs for Tsar Alexander III and his son Nicholas II until 1917, when the Russian revolution broke out. Today, the term “Fabergé eggs” has become a synonym of luxury and the eggs are regarded as masterpieces of the jeweler’s art. More significantly, perhaps, they serve as reminders of the last Russian imperial family.",

The word “sigma” is a statistical term that measures how far a given process falls short of perfection. The central idea behind Six Sigma is that if a company can measure how many “defects” they have in a commercial production process, they can systematically figure out how to eliminate the problems and get as close to “zero defects” as possible.Training and teamwork are essential elements of the Six Sigma methodology. In other words, companies need to have their team leaders and team members trained to implement the Six Sigma processes. They must learn to use the measurement and improvement tools. They also need to learn communication skills necessary for them to involve customers and suppliers and to serve their needs. Six Sigma was developed in 1986 by Motorola, an American telecommunications company. Engineers in Motorola used it as an informal name for a plan to reduce faults in production processes. A few years later, Motorola extended the name “Six Sigma” to mean a general performance improvement method, beyond purely “defect reduction” in the production process. In 1995, Jack Welch, CEO of General Electrics (GE), decided to implement Six Sigma in GE; and by 1998 GE claimed that Six Sigma had generated over three-quarters of a billion dollars of cost savings. By 2000, Six Sigma was effectively established as an industry in its own right, involving the training, consultancy and implementation of Six Sigma methodology in all sorts of organizations around the world. Organizations as diverse as local governments, prisons, hospitals, the armed forces, banks, and multi-national corporations have been adopting Six Sigma for quality and process improvement.",

      "content": "Imagine two bottlenose dolphins swimming in the Gulf of Mexico. You hear a series of clicks, whistles, and whines coming from each, much like a conversation. We can’t be sure what they are discussing, but scientists do believe dolphins call each other by “name.” A recent study suggests the marine mammals not only produce their own unique “signature whistles,” but they also recognize and mimic whistles of other dolphins they are close to and want to see again. It seems that dolphins can call those they know by mimicking their distinct whistles. “They’re abstract names,” said Randall Wells, one of the authors of the study.To conduct the study, the researchers listened to recordings of about 250 wild bottlenose dolphins made around Florida’s Sarasota Bay from 1984 to 2009, and four captive dolphins at a nearby aquarium.Some wild dolphins were briefly captured and held in separate nets by the research team, allowing them to hear but not see each other. Researchers found that dolphins familiar with each other would mimic the whistle of another in that group when they were separated. Most of this took place among mothers and calves, or among males who were close associates, suggesting it was affiliative and not aggressive—somewhat like calling out the name of a missing child or friend. Whistle copying of this sort was not found in dolphins that happened to cross paths in the wild.This use of vocal copying is similar to its use in human language, where the maintenance of social bonds appears to be more important than the immediate defense of resources. This helps differentiate dolphins’ vocal learning from that of birds, which tend to address one another in a more “aggressive context.” If confirmed, this would be a level of communication rarely found in nature. If dolphins can identify themselves and address friends with just a few squeaks, it’s easy to imagine what else they’re saying. However, as the authors of the study point out, all we can do right now is still imagine.",

Thousands of years ago a group of ancient volcanoes spewed out layer upon layer of thick ash and lava which formed the Cappadocia region, where the Goreme National Park is now located. Over the centuries the wind and rain worked their magic on this land, carving out spectacular gorges and leaving behind the dramatic towering formations of rock pillars that reach heights of 40 meters. These amazing structures are usually called “fairy chimneys.” They come in an extraordinary range of shapes and sizes, but most are tall and resemble king trumpet mushrooms with a cap on top. The top stone is the hardest part of each formation and protects the softer rock underneath from erosion. Eventually, however, these caps fall off, whereupon the wind and rain start to cut away the cone until it, too, collapses.

Humans, too, have left their unique mark on the region. The Byzantine Christians inhabited the area in the fourth century. They carved thousands of cave churches, chapels, and monasteries out of rock. Many of these churches were decorated with beautiful wall paintings whose colors still retain all their original freshness.

      "content": "With soaring rock formations, uniquely-rippled landscapes, and mysterious underground cities, the Goreme National Park is an incredible tourist attraction in central Turkey. Thousands of years ago a group of ancient volcanoes spewed out layer upon layer of thick ash and lava which formed the Cappadocia region, where the Goreme National Park is now located. Over the centuries the wind and rain worked their magic on this land, carving out spectacular gorges and leaving behind the dramatic towering formations of rock pillars that reach heights of 40 meters. These amazing structures are usually called “fairy chimneys.” They come in an extraordinary range of shapes and sizes, but most are tall and resemble king trumpet mushrooms with a cap on top. The top stone is the hardest part of each formation and protects the softer rock underneath from erosion. Eventually, however, these caps fall off, whereupon the wind and rain start to cut away the cone until it, too, collapses. The unique landforms of the Goreme valley have created its lunar-like landscape, also known as a moonscape.But the Goreme National Park has always been much more than its dramatic scenery. Humans, too, have left their unique mark on the region. The Byzantine Christians inhabited the area in the fourth century. They carved thousands of cave churches, chapels, and monasteries out of rock. Many of these churches were decorated with beautiful wall paintings whose colors still retain all their original freshness. The Byzantine Christians even carved out entire underground villages in an effort to hide from the Romans and later, the Muslims. To this day, many of these villages are still inhabited and many of the rock-cut storerooms are still stuffed with grapes, lemons, potatoes and flat bread waiting for the winter.",

      "content": "For many years, I was convinced that my suffering was due to my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts, and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix everything. Perhaps our worst mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal. We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long while to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes toward ourselves, the whole world changes.",

At least 25,000 people died in the quake—nearly a third of the city's population. And thousands more were left homeless, hungry, and grieving. Bam was a city of mud-brick houses, old monuments and an ancient castle. But nearly everything crumbled in the disaster. One reason the earthquake caused such damage was that Bam's buildings were made mostly from baked mud. These buildings collapsed in heaps of dust and sand. Bam was best known for its 2,000-year-old castle built out of mud, straw, and the trunks of palm trees. The castle was so big that it was once the city of Bam itself. Public dwellings lined its ground level; a marketplace and two mosques also fit comfortably inside. Bam once blossomed as a trading post on the Silk Road. In the 16th and 17th centuries, treasures from the Far East were carried along the road into the capital cities of Europe. Fifty years ago, teams of architects began restoring the historic treasures of the city. Ever since, thousands of visitors have come to admire them. \tIn the face of this tragedy, food and other supplies from around the world landed in the provincial capital of Kerman on Sunday. With such support, spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed, “We will rebuild Bam stronger than before.”",

It is caused by disruption to the internal biological clock, and may lead to digestive problems, tiredness, and sleep disruption.Generally speaking, our biological clock is slightly disturbed if we just move into the next time zone, but jet lag becomes a problem once we have passed through three or four time zones. The body takes about one day to get over each hour of time difference. But the seriousness of jet lag problems also depends on our direction of travel. If we go north or south, we won’t notice any difference, because there is usually no time zone change. However, if we travel west we will be in advance of ourselves as far as our internal clock is concerned, and problems may arise. A west-to-east journey, on the other hand, makes us late compared to the local time. It often demands even greater effort in adjustment since we are not quick enough to catch up with the new time schedule.

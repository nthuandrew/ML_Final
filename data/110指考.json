      "content": "Located in Black Canyon straddling the border between Nevada and Arizona in the southwestern region of the United States, Hoover Dam is named one of the Top 10 Construction Achievements of the 20th century. The dam, constructed between 1931 and 1936, was the largest of its kind at the time. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers and cost over one hundred lives.Since about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water, and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, the US Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by Six Companies, Inc. However, such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The extreme summer heat and lack of facilities near the site also presented tremendous difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the finished dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.The initial design of the dam, which was more concerned with the dam’s functionality than its exterior, was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale. So Gordon B. Kaufmann, the architect who was brought in to redesign the exterior, greatly streamlined the design and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. Allen Tupper True, an American illustrator, was also hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. He integrated into his design the images and colors based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, clouds, and animals, thereby creating symbolic patterns which appear both ancient and modern.Today, Hoover Dam has become a national historic landmark. Standing at more than 725 feet above the Colorado River, the highest concrete dam in the Western Hemisphere continues to draw crowds 85 years after its creation, attracting more than a million visitors a year.",

It was developed in the ancient Arabian Desert around 4000 B.C. In the past, falconry mainly involved hunting with falcons to supplement one’s diet. But now, it has become the favorite sport and pastime in the Arabian Peninsula.Falconry includes three major processes: acquiring the falcons, training them, and hunting with them. Every year, falconers begin capturing wild falcons in June and July, the migration season. The best birds to catch are the ones with naturally nurtured hunting skills, aged one or two years. Once the falcons are captured, their heads are immediately covered with a leather hood. This is essential because they imprint as their master whomever they see first after the hood is removed. Right after a bird is caught, the training process starts. It begins by depriving the bird of food to make it easier to tame. The birds are taught to know their own name and respond to their master when called. Arab falconers live with their birds day and night in order to build a strong relationship with them.By the end of October or mid-November, the trained falcons are ready to hunt in the desert. They have excellent vision, 2.6 times greater than that of a human. They are also the fastest divers on the planet. One hunting technique that sets them apart from other animals is that they can be trained to deliver their prey, without killing it first. This is vital in Islamic culture because animals used for food must still be alive to ensure that the meat is halal, that is, properly prepared according to Islamic law.Falcons have played such a crucial role in traditional Islamic cultures that a number of countries in the Middle East have made them their national bird. Falconry has grown so popular that specialist hospitals have been established to take care of these magnificent birds. Falcons are even issued their own passports.

      },
      "content": "Since golf started in the 15th century, many advances have occurred in the game, including significant changes to the golf ball. Early golf was played with a rounded wooden ball before the Featherie, a leather sack stuffed with goose or chicken feathers, became the norm. Then, in 1848, the Gutta Percha ball was introduced, which was made from the juice of the leaves of the gutta tree (a tropical tree native to Malaysia) and was considerably more durable and affordable than its predecessor. The next advancement occurred in the early 1900s with the development of the Haskell. It was the first ball featuring a center rubber core and an outer cover. The Haskell traveled up to 20 yards farther than the Gutta Percha ball and was more durable. In 1905, William Taylor introduced the first dimpled ball, a ball covered with tiny holes on the surface. By the 1930s, golf balls with rows of dimples were accepted as the standard design. Most golf balls today consist of rubber thread wound around a rubber core and coated with dimpled enamel.Dimples play an important role in a golf ball’s performance because these markings and patterns enhance the ball’s aerodynamics. When a ball is hit and moves through the air, it experiences two major aerodynamic forces: lift and drag. Drag slows the forward motion, and lift acts in a direction vertical to it. With dimples added to the ball, the force that pulls back on the ball is minimized, allowing it to travel faster and longer. Dimples also help to force the airflow downward, which pushes the ball upward. These are the same principles of aerodynamics that airplanes use to fly. In general, golf balls with small, shallow dimples tend to have a longer, lower flight path, whereas those with deeper dimples have a higher flight path. Golfers can choose their balls based on what they need for a particular shot or for particular weather.",

      "content": "Since golf started in the 15th century, many advances have occurred in the game, including significant changes to the golf ball. Early golf was played with a rounded wooden ball before the Featherie, a leather sack stuffed with goose or chicken feathers, became the norm. Then, in 1848, the Gutta Percha ball was introduced, which was made from the juice of the leaves of the gutta tree (a tropical tree native to Malaysia) and was considerably more durable and affordable than its predecessor. The next advancement occurred in the early 1900s with the development of the Haskell. It was the first ball featuring a center rubber core and an outer cover. The Haskell traveled up to 20 yards farther than the Gutta Percha ball and was more durable. In 1905, William Taylor introduced the first dimpled ball, a ball covered with tiny holes on the surface. By the 1930s, golf balls with rows of dimples were accepted as the standard design. Most golf balls today consist of rubber thread wound around a rubber core and coated with dimpled enamel.Dimples play an important role in a golf ball’s performance because these markings and patterns enhance the ball’s aerodynamics. When a ball is hit and moves through the air, it experiences two major aerodynamic forces: lift and drag. Drag slows the forward motion, and lift acts in a direction vertical to it. With dimples added to the ball, the force that pulls back on the ball is minimized, allowing it to travel faster and longer. Dimples also help to force the airflow downward, which pushes the ball upward. These are the same principles of aerodynamics that airplanes use to fly. In general, golf balls with small, shallow dimples tend to have a longer, lower flight path, whereas those with deeper dimples have a higher flight path. Golfers can choose their balls based on what they need for a particular shot or for particular weather.",

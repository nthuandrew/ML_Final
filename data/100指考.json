They are among the most expensive of the world’s natural foods, often commanding as much as US$250 to US$450 per pound. Truffles are actually mushrooms, but unusual ones. They live in close association with the roots of specific trees and their fruiting bodies grow underground. This is why they are difficult to find.Truffles are harvested in  with the aid of female pigs or truffle dogs, which are able to detect the strong smell of mature truffles underneath the surface of the ground. Female pigs are especially sensitive to the odor of the truffles because it is similar to the smell given off by male pigs. The use of pigs is risky, though, because of their natural tendency to eat any remotely edible thing. For this reason, dogs have been trained to dig into the ground wherever they find this odor, and they willingly exchange their truffle for a piece of bread and a pat on the head. Some truffle merchants dig for their prizes themselves when they see truffle flies hovering around the base of a tree. Once a site has been discovered, truffles can be collected in subsequent years.To enjoy the wonderful flavor of what has been described as an earthly jewel, you must eat fresh, uncooked specimens shortly after they have been harvested. The strength of their flavor decreases rapidly with time, and much of it is lost before some truffles reach the market. To preserve them, gourmet experts suggest putting them in closed glass jars in a refrigerator. Another recommendation is to store them whole in bland oil.",

      "content": "Spider webs are one of the most fascinating examples of animal architecture. The most beautiful and structurally ordered are the orb webs. The main function of the web is to intercept and hold flying prey, such as flies, bees and other insects, long enough for the spider to catch them. In order to do so, the threads of the web have to withstand the impact forces from large and heavy prey as well as environmental forces from wind and rain for at least a day in most cases.The orb web is found to have two main characteristics. The first is its geometry, which consists of an outer frame and a central part from which threads radiate outward. Enclosed in the frame are capture spirals winding round and round from the web center out to the frame. The whole web is in tension and held in place by anchor threads, which connect the frame to the surrounding vegetation or objects. The second and perhaps most important characteristic is the material with which it is built. Spider silk is a kind of natural composite that gives this lightweight fiber a tensile strength comparable to that of steel, while at the same time making it very elastic. Two types of silk threads are used in the web. One is highly elastic and can stretch to almost twice its original length before breaking and, for most types of spiders, is covered in glue. This type is used in the capture spiral for catching and holding prey. The other is stiffer and stronger, and is used for the radius, frames and anchor threads, which allows the web to withstand prey impact and to keep its structural strength through a wide range of environmental conditions.",

      "content": "All pop artists like to say that they owe their success to their fans. In the case of British band VM, it’s indeed true. The band is currently recording songs because 358 fans contributed the £100,000 needed for the project. The arrangement came via MMC, an online record label that uses Web-based, social-network-style “crowd-funding” to finance its acts.Here’s how it works: MMC posts demos and videos of 10 artists on its website, and users are invited to invest from £10 to £1,000 in the ones they most enjoy or think are most likely to become popular. Once an act reaches £100,000, the financing process is completed, and the money is used to pay for recording and possibly a concert tour. Profits from resulting music sales, concerts, and merchandise are split three ways: investors get to divide 40%; another 40% goes to MMC; the artist pockets 20%. The payoff for investors can be big. One fan in France who contributed £4,250 got his money back 22 times over.Crowd-funding musical acts is not new. But MMC takes the concept to another level. First of all, investors can get cash rather than just goodies like free downloads or tickets. Also, MMC is a record label. It has the means to get its music distributed around the world and to market artists effectively. “Artists need professional support,” says the CEO of MMC’s international division. While digital technology and the Net have created a do-it-yourself boom among musicians, success is still a long shot. Out of the 20,000 records released in the U.. in 2009, only 14 DIY acts made it to the Top 200. Also, with less revenue from recorded music, music companies have become less likely to take risks, which has led to fewer artists receiving funding. The crowd-funding model, however, allows for more records to be made by spreading risk among hundreds of backers. And the social-network aspect of the site helps expand fan bases; that is, investors become a promotional army.",

      "content": "In science fiction TV programs such as tar Trek, tractor beams are used to tow spaceships and move objects. For years, scientists have labored to replicate this feat. In 2013, they succeeded. A team of British and Czech scientists, led by Dr. Tomas Cizmar, say they have created a real-life “tractor beam,” like the kind from tar Trek, which uses a beam of light to attract objects, at least at a microscopic level.Light manipulation techniques have existed since the 1970s, but this is thought to be the first time a light beam has been used to draw objects towards a light source. Usually when microscopic objects are hit by a beam of light, they are forced along the direction of the beam. After many years’ research, Dr. Cizmar’s team discovered a technique that allows for the radiant force of light to be reversed and to use the negative force to draw out certain particles. Dr. Cizmar says that even though it is a few years away from practical use, the technology has huge potential for medical research. In particular, the tractor beam is highly selective in the particles it can attract, so it can pick up particles that have specific properties, such as size or composition, in a mixture. “Eventually, this could be used to separate white blood cells, for example,” Dr. Cizmar told BBC News.It has been a primary plot device in science fiction TV programs and movies to allow objects like spaceships to be trapped in a beam of light. But Dr. Cizmar said this particular technique would not eventually lead to that. A transfer of energy happens in the process. On a microscopic scale that is OK, but on a large scale it would cause huge problems. A large object could be destroyed by the heating, which results from the massive amount of energy necessary to pull it.",

      "content": "In the partathlon, one of the world’s toughest ultra-marathons, runners run , about six marathons, within 36 hours. The runners start in Athens, and run all the way to historical parta.The partathlon’s heritage goes back to 490 B.C., when Pheidippides, an Athenian, made the journey to parta to ask the partans for help in fighting the invading Persians. It is recorded that he reached parta on the day after he left Athens. In 1982, this story sparked the interest of a British air-force officer and long-distance runner called John Foden, who wondered if it really was possible to run from Athens to parta and arrive the next day. With four other officers, Foden decided to see for himself; after a 36-hour slog they arrived in parti, as the town is now called. That achievement inspired the organization of the first partathlon a year later.The partathlon’s attraction has two sources. The first is the difficulty of finishing it. The partathlon is not the most difficult race, but it combines lots of different tests. There is the heat of the Greek day, and then the plunge in temperatures when darkness falls. There are climbs: the route includes a series of ascents, among them a 1,200-meter mountain pass in the dead of night. Above all, there is the relentless pressure of the clock. The second reason is that the idea of retracing Pheidippides’s footsteps still grips many participants. It feels like racing in history, passing through places where history began.As finishers receive a laurel wreath and water from schoolgirls, many are overjoyed with emotion. However, the euphoria is fleeting. Within a few minutes, their joints and muscles start to seize up: after the race, parti resembles the set of a zombie film as participants lumber slowly around on legs that will not bend. But the itch to do it all over again soon appears.",

      "content": "In the partathlon, one of the world’s toughest ultra-marathons, runners run , about six marathons, within 36 hours. The runners start in Athens, and run all the way to historical parta.The partathlon’s heritage goes back to 490 B.C., when Pheidippides, an Athenian, made the journey to parta to ask the partans for help in fighting the invading Persians. It is recorded that he reached parta on the day after he left Athens. In 1982, this story sparked the interest of a British air-force officer and long-distance runner called John Foden, who wondered if it really was possible to run from Athens to parta and arrive the next day. With four other officers, Foden decided to see for himself; after a 36-hour slog they arrived in parti, as the town is now called. That achievement inspired the organization of the first partathlon a year later.The partathlon’s attraction has two sources. The first is the difficulty of finishing it. The partathlon is not the most difficult race, but it combines lots of different tests. There is the heat of the Greek day, and then the plunge in temperatures when darkness falls. There are climbs: the route includes a series of ascents, among them a 1,200-meter mountain pass in the dead of night. Above all, there is the relentless pressure of the clock. The second reason is that the idea of retracing Pheidippides’s footsteps still grips many participants. It feels like racing in history, passing through places where history began.As finishers receive a laurel wreath and water from schoolgirls, many are overjoyed with emotion. However, the euphoria is fleeting. Within a few minutes, their joints and muscles start to seize up: after the race, parti resembles the set of a zombie film as participants lumber slowly around on legs that will not bend. But the itch to do it all over again soon appears.",

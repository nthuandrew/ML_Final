The city has some 12,000 cafés varying in size, grandeur, and significance. The cafés are like an extension of the French living room, a place to start and end the day, to gossip and debate.  41   The oldest café in  is Le Procope. It was opened in 1686 by Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, the man who turned  into a coffee-drinking society.   42   By the end of the 18th century, all of  was intoxicated with coffee and the city supported some 700 cafés.   43   By the 1840s the number of cafés had grown to 3,000. The men who gathered in these cafés and set the theme of the times included journalists, playwrights and writers. Around the turn of the 20th century, the sidewalk cafés became the meeting halls for artists and literary figures.  44   The artists gathered at the café may not be as great as those of the past, but faces worth watching are just the same.   45   You’ll see the old men in navy berets; ultra-thin, bronzed women with hair dyed bright orange; and schoolchildren sharing an afternoon chocolate with their mothers. The café in  has always been a place for seeing and being seen.(A)\tWhen did the cafés in  start?(B)\tLinger a bit and you will see that the Parisian stereotypes are still alive and well.(C)\tNowadays in  cafés still play the role of picture windows for observing contemporary life.(D)\tThese were like all-male clubs, with many functioning as centers of political life and discussion.(E)\tLe Procope attracted ’s political and literary elite, and thus played an important part among the upper class.五、閱讀測驗（22分）說明：第46至56題，每題請分別根據各篇文章的文意選出一個最適當的選項，標示在答案卡之「選擇題答案區」。每題答對得2分，答錯或劃記多於一個選項者倒扣2/3分，倒扣到本大題之實得分數為零為止。未作答者，不給分亦不扣分。第 46 至 49 題為題組The Lego Group had a very humble beginning in the workshop of , a carpenter from . Christiansen began creating wooden toys in 1932. Two years later, he stumbled on the Lego name by putting together the first two letters of the Danish words Leg and Godt, which mean “play well.” The name could be interpreted as “I put together” in ; it also corresponds to the Greek verb meaning “gather” or “pick up.”In 1947, the company expanded to making plastic toys. At first, the use of plastic for toy manufacture was not highly regarded by retailers and consumers of the time. Many of the Lego Group’s shipments were returned, following poor sales. However, Christiansen’s son, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, saw the immense potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play. As the junior managing director of the Lego Group, he spent years trying to improve the “locking” ability of the bricks and made the bricks more versatile. In 1958, the modern interlocking brick design was finally developed and patented.Today Lego is sold in more than 130 countries. Every minute 33,824 Lego bricks are made, and kids around the world spend 5 billion hours a year playing with Lego. There will be more than 400 million people playing with Lego bricks this year. On average, every person in the world owns 62 Lego bricks, and about seven Lego sets are sold every second.This year Lego fans all over the world are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the tiny building blocks. Though already 50 years old, Lego is still the same product it was in the 1950s. Bricks bought then are still compatible with current bricks and that is probably the reason the toy has never fallen out of favor.46.\tWhich of the following is true about the name Lego?(A) It is a combination of Greek and Latin words.(B) It was created by ’s son.(C) It was created in 1947 for naming the plastic toys.(D) It came from Danish words meaning “play” and “well.”47.\tWhen did the Lego brick become as a creative form of toy?(A) 1958\t(B) 1947\t(C) 1934\t(D) 193248.\tWhich of the following is true in describing the popularity of Lego?(A) More than 5 billion people in the world own Lego sets.(B) Children spend an average of 62 dollars on Lego bricks each year.(C) People in the world spend 400 million hours playing with Lego every year.(D) The Lego Group now produces more than 30 thousand toy bricks every minute.49.\tWhat is most likely the reason why Lego still remains popular?(A) Old Lego bricks may still be connected to new ones.(B) The company hasn’t changed its name since 1947 .(C) The material for the bricks has proved to be safe.(D) The price of the toy is relatively reasonable.第 50 至 53 題為題組During my ninth-grade year, I suffered from anorexia nervosa. It was not enough to be thin. I had to be the thinnest. Now, however, fully recovered, I can reflect back and realize that my wishes were more complex than fitting into size five pants. Many of my subconscious emotions were related to my relationship with my father. As I was growing up, his work always came first. Sometimes I would not see him for up to two weeks. Not only did he devote his whole self to his work, but he expected me to do the same (“You cannot get anywhere unless you go to the best universities!”). Though, consciously, I never felt pressure to please him, I began dieting after the first time he told me I looked fat.At the time, all I knew was that I had to be skinny—skinnier than anyone else. Every month my father went to  for a week or so and on the days he left, sorrow and emptiness consumed me: Daddy was leaving. Then, I turned to focus on a mysterious weakness—a helpless childlike emotion that came from starving. I liked to know that I needed to be taken care of; maybe Daddy would take care of me.Now, two years later and thirty-eight pounds heavier, I have come to realize that I cannot alter my father’s inability to express his feelings. Instead, I must accept myself. I know that I am a valuable person who strives to achieve and accomplish. But I cannot strive solely for others. By starving, I attempted to gain pride in myself by obtaining my father’s approval or acknowledgment of my value as a person. But the primary approval must come from me, and I feel secure now that I can live with that knowledge safely locked in my mind.50.\tWhat is “anorexia nervosa” as mentioned in the first paragraph?(A) It is an inability to express one’s feelings.(B) It describes a situation of feeling insecure.(C) It refers to people who are emotionally unstable.(D) It is an illness that makes one want to stop eating.51.\tWhy did the writer suffer from anorexia nervosa?(A) She was told by her father to take care of herself.(B) She wanted to go to the best university.(C) She wanted her father’s attention.(D) She grew up in a poor family.52.\tWhich of the following statements is true about the writer?(A) She has problems controlling her tempers.(B) She is proud of herself for working hard to succeed.(C) She has had great confidence in herself since childhood.(D) She has changed her father’s way of expressing himself.53.\tWhat’s the writer’s purpose of writing this passage?(A) To blame her father.(B) To report a case of child abuse.(C) To reflect on a stage of growing up.(D) To teach people how to lose weight.第 54 至 56 題為題組Africa is a land of many ethnic groups, but when Europeans carved  into colonies, they gave no consideration to the territories of African ethnic groups. Some borderlines were drawn that split same groups into different colonies. Other borders threw different groups together. Sometimes the groups thrown together were enemies.When the colonies became independent nations, these same borderlines were often maintained. Today, the Somali people remain split among , , , and . On the other hand, almost every African nation is home to more than one ethnic group. In , for example, live the Hausa, the Fulani, the Yoruba, the Ibo, and many smaller groups.Conflicts have arisen over the way in which ethnic groups were split apart and thrown together. For example, a war between  and  was fought because Somalis wanted all their people to be a part of one nation. A civil war in , on the other hand, was triggered partly by conflicts between ethnic groups within that nation. Similar conflicts between ethnic groups arose in , , and  as well. One principal goal among African nations today, therefore, is to help make it possible for their many ethnic groups to live together in peace.54.\tWhat happened to the territorial lines drawn in  by the Europeans?(A) They disappeared as the Europeans no longer ruled the colonies.(B) They were respected by different ethnic groups.(C) They became borders between countries.(D) They became war memorials.55.\tWhat does the author think to be a reason for conflicts among the Africans?(A) Most ethnic groups have established their own countries.(B) One ethnic group is broken up among different countries.(C) Some Europeans invaded  to increase their colonies.(D) African nations fought the Europeans to expand their territories.56.\tWhat is the best title for the passage?(A) War and Peace in (B) : Borderlines Misplaced(C) European Colonization of (D)  Recovered and Reconstructed第貳部分：非選擇題（佔28分）一、英文翻譯（8分）說明：1. 將下列兩句中文翻譯成適當之英文，並將答案寫在「答案卷」上。\n",
